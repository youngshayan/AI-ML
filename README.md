# AI and ML Python Libraries Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **AI and Machine Learning Python Libraries** learning repository! This is where I document my journey of mastering AI and ML concepts by exploring Python's powerful libraries and implementing hands-on exercises.

## 🌟 Purpose of This Repository
The primary goal of this repository is to:
- Practice and understand the key libraries used in AI and ML (e.g., NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.).
- Solve real-world problems using data science and machine learning techniques.
- Showcase my progress and growth as I work toward becoming an expert in this field.


## 🔧 Tools and Libraries
Here are some of the key libraries and tools I will be using and learning:
- **Data Manipulation:** pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
- **Other Utilities:** Jupyter Notebook, SciPy, OpenCV, etc.


## 📖 My Learning Objectives
- Gain a solid understanding of Python libraries for AI and ML.
- Build hands-on experience with real-world datasets.
- Develop a portfolio of projects that demonstrate my skills.
- Prepare myself for opportunities in the AI and data science fields.
